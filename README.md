### Hi there 👋
Alex, 22.
Currently at Technical University of Varna.

📍 Varna, Bulgaria

Passionate about building scalable and maintainable solutions, I specialize in full-stack development with a focus on real-time applications. 
Experienced in Java, Spring Boot, React, and Apache Kafka, I’ve worked on projects like a messaging platform and a desktop ticketing app, 
applying SOLID principles and modern technologies. 
Currently studying at the Technical University of Varna, I’m eager to contribute to innovative projects and collaborate on GitHub.
